* Intro
  
CCL and LispWorks and other implementations have their own bridges to
the objective-c runtime.  This project is an attempt to create a
bridge that only uses CFFI so that arbitrary lisp implementations can
produce native mac GUIs.  In the long run, I hope to use this as the
basis for a new mac-native backend for McClim: but we'll see if that
ever happens.

* Installing

1. clone fwoar.lisputils from
   https://github.com/fiddlerwoaroof/fwoar.lisputils and put it
   somewhere quicklisp can find it (e.g. ~/quicklisp/local-projects)
2. run the demo:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
make run CCL=/path/to/ccl
   #+END_SRC
